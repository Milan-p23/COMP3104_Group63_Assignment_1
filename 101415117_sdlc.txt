The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured framework that outlines the various stages involved in developing software applications. It provides a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software, ensuring that the final product meets the specified requirements and quality standards. The SDLC typically consists of several key phases:

Requirement Gathering and Analysis: This initial phase involves gathering detailed requirements from stakeholders, including clients, end-users, and developers. Understanding user needs and business objectives is crucial for defining the scope of the project.

Planning: Once requirements are understood, the next step is to create a detailed project plan that outlines the timeline, resources, and budget needed for the project. This phase often includes risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

Design: In this phase, architects and developers create the software architecture and design specifications. This includes defining the system architecture, user interfaces, and data models, ensuring that the design aligns with the gathered requirements.

Implementation (Coding): During the implementation phase, developers begin writing the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase also involves integrating different modules and components.

Testing: After coding, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and rectify any defects or bugs. Various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, are employed to ensure quality.

Deployment: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to the production environment. This phase may involve user training and documentation.

Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues, updated, and enhanced based on user feedback and changing requirements.

The SDLC provides a clear and organized approach, ensuring that software is developed efficiently, meets user expectations, and is delivered on time and within budget.
