Learning DevOps is critical in the software development cycle because it revolutionises the 
traditional method of producing, delivering, and maintaining software by encouraging collaboration, 
automation, and efficiency. Here's why DevOps is important:

1. Consistent Environments: DevOps approaches, particularly the use of tools like as \
    Docker and Kubernetes, ensure that the environments for development, testing, and production are all same.
    By generating and controlling these environments through code, the possibility of differences between 
    these phases is removed. This consistency helps to prevent the typical issue when software works in one
    environment but fails in another.
    
2. Reduced Deployment Failures: DevOps prioritises continuous integration and automated testing,
    ensuring that every change is verified and validated before merging. This procedure considerably
    decreases the possibility of deployment failures due to defects or misconfigurations. Frequent, short 
    updates are easier to handle, allowing you to discover and address problems before they harm users.
