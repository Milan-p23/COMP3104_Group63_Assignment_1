COMP 3104 is a DevOps course that usually covers the ideas, processes, and technologies used 
in DevOps (Development and Operations). The training seeks to bridge the gap between software development
and IT operations by supporting automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), 
and cross-team communication. While the specifics may differ based on the school, here's a broad summary 
of what the course may include:

Key Features :

1. Introduction to DevOps: Learn about DevOps' philosophy, practices, and culture. 
    Improve workflow efficiency by encouraging collaboration between development and operations teams.

2. Version Control Systems: Using Git and other version control systems to manage code, track changes, 
    and foster collaboration.

3. Automation Tools: Learn how to automate configuration management (Ansible, Chef, Puppet), testing, and 
    deployment (Jenkins, Travis CI).

4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Creating pipelines that automatically create, test,
     and deploy code. Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitLab CI are commonly used.

5. Cloud Computing and Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Understanding cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and 
    Google Cloud. Implementing IaC using Terraform and CloudFormation.

6. Containerisation: Using Docker and Kubernetes to containerise and orchestrate applications, 
    ensuring they are scalable and portable.

Learning Outcomes:

1. Acquire expertise in automating software testing, deployment, and monitoring.

2. Set up CI/CD pipelines to simplify software delivery.

3. Become familiar with cloud-based infrastructures and containerised apps.

4. Learn how to effectively cooperate with development and operational teams.

This course is frequently orientated at students with prior experience in software development and IT infrastructure.
