COMP 3104 focuses on the core principles and practices of DevOps, a transformative approach designed to enhance collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver high-quality software more efficiently. The course provides a comprehensive 
foundation in the methodologies, tools, and best practices that underpin successful DevOps implementations, ensuring students are well-prepared for the dynamic landscape of modern software development.

The curriculum delves into essential concepts such as continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and infrastructure as code (IaC). These principles are critical for automating software deployment, testing, and monitoring, 
thus reducing the time between writing code and delivering it to production. By adopting CI/CD pipelines, students will learn how to streamline their workflows, improve code quality, and minimize deployment risks.

Students will gain hands-on experience with a range of popular tools and frameworks, including Jenkins for CI/CD automation, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and Terraform for managing cloud infrastructure as code. This practical 
experience will enable students to automate deployment pipelines effectively and manage scalable cloud environments. Additionally, they will explore configuration management tools like Ansible and Puppet, which further enhance operational efficiency.

The course also emphasizes key methodologies that align with DevOps practices, such as Agile and Lean. These approaches foster a culture of continuous improvement and rapid iteration, encouraging students to adopt practices that promote flexibility, responsiveness, and 
customer-centric development. By understanding how to integrate Agile practices with DevOps, students will be equipped to work in fast-paced environments where adaptability is crucial.

Monitoring and logging are integral components of a successful DevOps strategy. The course highlights the significance of implementing robust monitoring practices to ensure system reliability and performance. Students will learn how to utilize tools such as Prometheus, 
Grafana, and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to collect, analyze, and visualize metrics and logs, enabling them to gain insights into system performance and user behavior.

Moreover, the course will introduce students to the concept of feedback loops in DevOps, emphasizing their role in driving enhancements in development processes. By leveraging feedback from stakeholders, monitoring tools, and automated testing, students will learn 
how to implement a proactive approach to issue resolution and system optimization. This continuous feedback mechanism is essential for fostering a culture of accountability and improvement within teams.

By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of DevOps principles and be equipped with the skills necessary to contribute effectively to modern software development teams. They will understand the importance of 
collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback in meeting the demands of rapid delivery and innovation in today's technology landscape. Ultimately, COMP 3104 prepares students not only to implement DevOps practices but also to become champions 
of change within their organizations, driving transformation and efficiency in software development and operations.
