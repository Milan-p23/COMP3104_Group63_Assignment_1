COMP 3104 focuses on the core principles and practices of DevOps, a transformative approach designed to enhance collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver high-quality software more efficiently. The course provides a comprehensive 
foundation in the methodologies, tools, and best practices that underpin successful DevOps implementations, ensuring students are well-prepared for the dynamic landscape of modern software development.

The curriculum delves into essential concepts such as continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and infrastructure as code (IaC). These principles are critical for automating software deployment, testing, and monitoring, 
thus reducing the time between writing code and delivering it to production. By adopting CI/CD pipelines, students will learn how to streamline their workflows, improve code quality, and minimize deployment risks.
