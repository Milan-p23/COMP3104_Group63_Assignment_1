Introduction to COMP 3104 - DevOps:

COMP 3104 focuses on the core principles and practices of DevOps, which aims to enhance collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver high-quality software 
more efficiently. The course covers essential concepts such as continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and infrastructure as code (IaC), 
emphasizing their role in automating software deployment, testing, and monitoring. Students will explore a range of popular tools and frameworks, 
including Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, to gain hands-on experience in automating deployment pipelines and managing cloud infrastructure. 
The curriculum also addresses key methodologies, such as Agile and Lean, that align with DevOps practices to foster a 
culture of continuous improvement and rapid iteration.

Additionally, the course highlights the significance of implementing robust monitoring and logging practices 
to ensure system reliability and performance. Students will learn how to utilize feedback loops to drive 
enhancements in their development processes, thereby facilitating a proactive approach to issue resolution 
and system optimization.


By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of DevOps principles and be 
equipped with the skills necessary to contribute effectively to modern software development teams, 
enabling them to meet the demands of rapid delivery and innovation in today's technology landscape.
