# CI/CD Pipeline

This repository is integrated with GitHub Actions to automate testing and builds on every push event. The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the .github/workflows/ci.yml file and includes the following steps:

1. *Clone the Repository*: The pipeline checks out the code from the repository.
2. *Set Up the Environment*: It sets up the environment on an Ubuntu server.
3. *Run Basic Checks*: The pipeline runs checks on branch changes, including file integrity and repository structure.
4. *Display Job Statuses*: Job statuses and relevant outputs are displayed.

This automation ensures that code pushed to the repository is automatically validated through continuous integration, improving code quality and collaboration.

## GitHub Actions CI Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is designed to trigger automatically on every push to any branch, helping maintain a functional, conflict-free repository. Below is an example configuration found in the .github/workflows/ci.yml file:

yaml
name: GitHub Actions CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run CI Pipeline
        run: |
          echo "CI pipeline triggered for ${GITHUB_REF}"
          # Add additional commands for testing and building the project.


## How It Works

- *Triggering the Workflow*: The workflow is automatically triggered by a push event to any branch.
- *Running on Ubuntu*: The pipeline runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
- *Checkout Action*: The actions/checkout@v4 action is used to check out the repository code.
- *CI Pipeline Execution*: The pipeline runs and outputs a message that includes the reference of the triggered event.

## Customization

You can customize the workflow by adding commands in the run section to include specific testing, linting, or build commands necessary for your project.
