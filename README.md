# CI/CD Pipeline

This repository is integrated with GitHub Actions to automate testing and builds on every push event. The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the .github/workflows/ci.yml file and consists of the following steps:

1. *Clone the Repository*: The pipeline checks out the code from the repository.
2. *Set Up the Environment*: It sets up the environment on an Ubuntu server.
3. *Run Basic Checks*: The pipeline runs checks on branch changes, including file integrity and repository structure.
4. *Display Job Statuses*: It displays job statuses and other relevant outputs.

This automation ensures that any code pushed to the repository is automatically validated through continuous integration, improving code quality and teamwork.

## GitHub Actions CI Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automatically trigger on every push to any branch, helping us maintain a functional and conflict-free repository. Below is an example configuration used in the .github/workflows/ci.yml file:

yaml
name: GitHub Actions CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run CI Pipeline
        run: |
          echo "CI pipeline triggered for ${GITHUB_REF}"
          # Add more commands to test and build the project.



## How It Works

- *Triggering the Workflow*: The workflow is automatically triggered by a push event to any branch in the repository.
- *Running on Ubuntu*: The pipeline runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
- *Checkout Action*: The first step uses actions/checkout@v4 to check out the repository code.
- *CI Pipeline Execution*: The subsequent step runs the CI pipeline and outputs a message that includes the reference of the triggered event.

## Customization

You can customize the workflow by adding additional commands in the run section to include your specific testing, linting, or build commands as needed for your project.
