Introduction to COMP 3104 - DevOps:

This course delves into the foundational principles and practices of DevOps, designed to improve collaboration between development and operations teams, resulting in the efficient delivery of high-quality software. This course introduces critical concepts such as continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and infrastructure as code (IaC), highlighting their significance in automating software deployment, testing, and monitoring processes.

Students will engage with a variety of widely-used tools and frameworks, including Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible, to gain practical experience in automating deployment workflows and managing cloud environments. The curriculum also covers essential methodologies like Agile and Lean, which align with DevOps practices to cultivate a culture of continuous improvement and fast-paced iteration.

Throughout the course, students will work on real-world projects that reinforce their learning, enabling them to apply DevOps principles to enhance collaboration, streamline workflows, and achieve seamless software delivery.

Students will also have the opportunity to participate in collaborative team projects, simulating real-world scenarios where they will be tasked with designing and implementing DevOps pipelines. These projects will encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills as students navigate challenges related to system integration, deployment strategies, and performance monitoring.

Assessments and Learning Outcomes
Students will be evaluated through a combination of individual and group assignments, quizzes, and a final project. These assessments will be designed to measure not only technical proficiency but also the ability to work effectively in teams and communicate solutions clearly. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the following competencies:

Proficiency in DevOps Tools: Ability to use popular DevOps tools and frameworks effectively in real-world scenarios, facilitating smooth deployment and integration processes.

Understanding of DevOps Methodologies: Knowledge of key methodologies such as Agile, Lean, and their application within a DevOps context to drive efficiency and innovation.

Problem-Solving Skills: Enhanced problem-solving abilities, particularly in the context of system integration and deployment challenges, enabling students to navigate and resolve complex issues.

Collaborative Mindset: A strong appreciation for the importance of collaboration and communication in software development and operations, preparing students to work effectively in team settings.

Industry-Relevant Skills:
To ensure the curriculum remains aligned with industry demands, guest speakers from leading tech companies will be invited to share insights on current trends and best practices in DevOps. This exposure will provide students with a real-world perspective on the skills and competencies required in the job market.
