COMP 3104 - DevOps is a comprehensive course designed to introduce students to the principles and practices of DevOps in software development. As a critical paradigm shift in the IT industry, DevOps emphasizes the integration of development and operations teams to enhance collaboration, efficiency, and continuous delivery of software products.

Students will explore key concepts such as Continuous Integration (CI), which encourages developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository, allowing for automated testing and early detection of issues. Continuous Delivery (CD) is also covered, ensuring that software can be reliably released at any time by automating the deployment process.

The course dives into essential tools and techniques, including version control systems (e.g., Git), which facilitate collaborative coding, and automated testing, which helps maintain software quality. Students will learn about containerization technologies like Docker, which allow applications to be packaged with all their dependencies, making them portable and consistent across different environments. Furthermore, the course introduces orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, which automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Through practical assignments and projects, students will gain hands-on experience in setting up CI/CD pipelines, managing infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring applications in real-time to ensure optimal performance. The course emphasizes the importance of collaboration and communication among team members, fostering a culture of shared responsibility and continuous improvement.

Additionally, students will learn to leverage cloud services and environments, such as AWS and Azure, to facilitate scalable and reliable software delivery, enabling organizations to meet the demands of a dynamic market. By the end of the course, participants will be equipped with the skills and knowledge to effectively implement DevOps practices, preparing them for careers in modern software development and operations. COMP 3104 aims to provide a solid foundation in DevOps, fostering an understanding of its critical role in enhancing software quality, accelerating delivery times, and driving business success in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
