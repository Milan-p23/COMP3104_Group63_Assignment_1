COMP 3104 - DevOps is a comprehensive course designed to immerse students in the principles and practices of DevOps within the realm of software development. Recognized as a critical paradigm shift in the IT industry, DevOps is centered around the seamless integration of development and operations teams. This integration fosters enhanced collaboration, efficiency, and continuous delivery of high-quality software products.

Course Overview
The course begins with an exploration of key concepts foundational to DevOps. One of the cornerstones of this methodology is Continuous Integration (CI), which encourages developers to frequently merge their code changes into a central repository. This practice allows for automated testing, leading to early detection and resolution of issues, thereby reducing integration problems later in the development cycle. Continuous Delivery (CD) builds on this concept, ensuring that software can be reliably released to production at any time by automating the deployment process. This capability is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in todayâ€™s fast-paced market.

Tools and Techniques
Students will gain hands-on experience with essential tools and techniques integral to DevOps:

Version Control Systems: The course emphasizes the use of Git, a widely adopted version control system that facilitates collaborative coding. Students learn to manage code versions efficiently, enabling multiple team members to work simultaneously without conflicts.

Automated Testing: Understanding automated testing is vital for maintaining software quality. The course covers various testing methodologies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing, enabling students to implement testing frameworks that ensure robust application performance.

Containerization Technologies: The course delves into containerization, focusing on tools like Docker. Students learn how to package applications along with all their dependencies into containers, ensuring portability and consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

Orchestration Tools: The introduction of orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes is a highlight of the course. Students will understand how Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, allowing for efficient resource utilization and high availability.

Practical Application and Collaboration
Through practical assignments and collaborative projects, students will set up CI/CD pipelines and gain experience in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), a practice that allows teams to manage and provision infrastructure using code instead of manual processes. This approach enhances consistency and reduces the likelihood of human error.

The course emphasizes real-time application monitoring, teaching students how to utilize monitoring tools to ensure optimal performance and quickly identify issues. The importance of collaboration and communication within cross-functional teams is also stressed, cultivating a culture of shared responsibility and continuous improvement among students.

Cloud Services
An integral component of the course is the exploration of cloud services and environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Students will learn how to leverage these platforms for scalable and reliable software delivery, enabling organizations to respond effectively to changing market demands and user expectations.

Career Preparation
By the end of the course, participants will be well-equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to implement DevOps practices effectively, positioning them for successful careers in modern software development and operations. COMP 3104 aims to provide a solid foundation in DevOps, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing software quality, accelerating delivery times, and driving business success in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
