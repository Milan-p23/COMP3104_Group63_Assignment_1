SDLC and the Importance of DevOps:


The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of phases such as planning, development, testing, and deployment.
DevOps is a set of practices that aims to bridge the gap between these phases, ensuring faster and  
more reliable software delivery.


SDLC Phases:
•⁠  ⁠Planning: Identifying requirements and creating a roadmap.
•⁠  ⁠Design: Architecting the solution.
•⁠  ⁠Development: Writing the code.


DevOps integrates with SDLC by automating testing and deployment in the later phases, such as testing and deployment.
This integration enables faster and more reliable software delivery.
DevOps also emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams.
This collaboration ensures that the software is deployable, maintainable, and scalable.
DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes facilitate this integration and collaboration.
These tools automate testing, deployment, and monitoring, making the software delivery process more efficient.
